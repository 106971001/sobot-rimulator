Development Constraints:
  - This is strictly a 2D simulator. It is not built to be extensible into the third dimension.

  - All solid geometries must be convex. This is the assumption in collision tests and sensor detection algorithms.
    If concave objects are needed, building them out of multiple convex objects should be a fully functional alternative.
